## Multi-objective Cooperative Coevolution Algorithm with a Master-Slave Mechanism for Seru Production (MOCCMS)
### This is an open-source GitHub project complementary to the jornal paper, which has been submitted to Applied Soft Computing (under review).

### Status update on Oct 25, 2021
A major revision is made and the paper is under review now.

### How to run
Prerequisites: the codes are tested in C#.net.

Run the following .sln file directly:

MOCCSNMS_NSGA2.sln

### Comparison Algorithm
The code of comparison algorithms are as follows.
